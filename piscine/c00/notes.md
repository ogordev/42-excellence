# parameters 
In C, a parameter refers to a variable in a function declaration or definition, while an argument is the actual value passed to the function when it is called. Parameters act as placeholders to receive 
the arguments passed during a function call, and they are also known as formal parameters. On the other hand, arguments are the actual values supplied during the function call 
and are also called actual parameters. For example, in the function Mult(int a, int b), a and b are parameters, and when the function is called with Mult(num1, num2), num1 and num2 are the arguments

When a method is called, the data passed into the method's parameters are referred to as arguments. Therefore, a parameter is a variable in a method definition, while the arguments are the actual data passed into the method's parameters

In summary, a parameter is a variable in a function declaration or definition, while an argument is the actual value passed to the function when it is called.
