Before we learn how to manipulate a bit and byte, we need to understand the difference between the two and how we can use them to manipulate numbers. For this example, Iâ€™ll be using integers int the way the are declared in the C programming language.
A bit is a single unit of information inside of a computer which will either be 1 or 0.
A byte is 8 bits, represented as 00000000.
